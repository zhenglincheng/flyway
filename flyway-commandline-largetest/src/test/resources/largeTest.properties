# Comma-separated list of schemas managed by Flyway. The first schema in the list will be the one containing the metadata table. (default: The default schema for the datasource connection)

# Name of Flyway's metadata table (default: schema_version)
# By default (single-schema mode) the metadata table is placed in the default schema for the connection provided by the datasource.
# When the flyway.schemas property is set (multi-schema mode), the metadata table is placed in the first schema of the list.

# Type of validation to be performed before migrating (default: NONE)
# Possible values are:
#   NONE : No validation is performed
#   ALL  : For each sql migration a CRC32 checksum is calculated when the sql script is executed. The validate mechanism checks if the sql migrations in the classpath still has the same checksum as the sql migration already executed in the database.
# flyway.validationMode=

# Action to take when validation fails (default: FAIL)
# Possible values are:
#   FAIL  : Throw an exception and fail
#   CLEAN : (Warning ! Do not use in production !) Cleans the database. This is exclusively intended as a convenience for development. Even tough we strongly recommend not to change migration scripts once they have been checked into SCM and run, this provides a way of dealing with this case in a smooth manner. The database will be wiped clean automatically, ensuring that the next migration will bring you back to the state checked into SCM.

# Flag to disable the check that a non-empty schema has been properly initialized with init. This check ensures Flyway does not migrate or clean the wrong database in case of a configuration mistake. Be careful when disabling this!
